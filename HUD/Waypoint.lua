PandaQuest / HUD/Waypoint.lua

The world waypoint marker: one icon over the 3D world showing which way to walk
to reach the main quest, and how far it is.

## What this is, and what it deliberately is not

It is a **yaw projection of a world point onto the screen**. The target's
bearing is compared against the player's facing, and the difference is mapped
through the horizontal field of view onto a screen X offset, so the marker sits
over the point on the horizon where the target lies. Turn left and it slides
right; put the target behind you and it pins to the screen edge.

Stock Octo has no camera getter, so that yaw marker cannot follow camera
tilt or zoom (`camera.pitch_not_readable_octo`). With the optional PandaTool
DLL (PANDATOOL_VERSION >= 101, `cameraProjection` "detected") the marker
instead projects the quest area centre through the engine's own camera
(`PlaceProjected`, `dll.pandatool_camera_projection`); the yaw marker stays as
the fallback. Without PandaTool the marker keeps its own `hudWorldMarker` gate.

## Where the facing comes from, and the one limit left

`GetPlayerFacing()` -- the character's rotation in radians, documented on the
updated client. This layer was gated off from 2026-08-22 to 2026-09-01 for the
want of exactly that call: the preceding build published no facing by any
route, so the marker could only be aimed from the direction the player was
*travelling*, which says nothing while they stand still and turn. HUD/PlayerHeading.lua
keeps that movement estimator as the fallback and reads the real facing first.
It also measures the client reading's angle convention against the estimator
rather than assuming it, because `GetPlayerFacing` is `documented`, not
`verified`, and a wrong zero axis would produce a marker that looks plausible
and points nowhere useful. That belongs there, not here: everything this file
receives from `PlayerHeading:Get` is already in the addon's convention.

The limit that remains is the camera, not the character. The marker is anchored
to where the **character** faces, and those agree whenever the camera sits
behind the character -- the normal case -- and drift apart while the player
holds right-mouse and looks around independently. There is no vertical
projection at all either: without camera pitch and target elevation the marker
can only sit on a fixed horizon band.

## Why the target is the map's own blue area

The point comes from Data/QuestTarget.lua, which is the same computation that
places the map's blue tiles -- not a second one. "Walk towards the blue area"
is the whole promise, so a separately derived centre that eventually disagreed
with the map would be a broken promise rather than a rounding difference.

## Why it hides more often than a Retail waypoint would

Both the map pins and this marker only work for direct coordinates in the
player's uniquely resolved current zone: child-area and continent transforms
are unmeasured on this client and Map/MapContext.lua refuses to guess them. On
top of that, GetPlayerMapPosition only projects the player while the world map
view is the player's own zone, so browsing the map to another zone takes the
player's position away with it. Every one of those exits is counted separately
in `hiddenReason`, and /pq waypoint prints the counts -- so "the marker never
appears" can be diagnosed without a screenshot.
